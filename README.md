# 📊 Telco Customer Churn Prediction

This project is developed as part of the **InternIntelligence Internship Program**.  
It focuses on predicting whether a customer will **churn (leave the service)** based on their demographic, usage, and contract details.  

By analyzing the Telco dataset, the project demonstrates how **Machine Learning models** can be applied to improve customer retention strategies.

## 📌 Project Overview  
- Performed **data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering**.  
- Applied **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** with visualizations.  
- Built and compared classification models:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Random Forest  
  - Gradient Boosting  
- Evaluated models using **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score**.
